# Cute Project

A simple qmake subdirs project with libs and tests. 

This aims to be a template/example qmake project with automated unit tests integration (using [catch](https://github.com/philsquared/Catch)). Tests are implememted in separated executabels/subdirs which get executed during compilation incrementally .. compilation fails if a test fails ..
